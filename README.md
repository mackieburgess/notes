# Notes

This is my reading notes site. When I’m reading an article I can post notes in here and
publish them for later reference. It’s built as one big page, where each of the logs is
pulled into the homepage in chronological order

This site is built in [Lume](https://lume.land). I’m really loving Lume recently. I also
rattled together some fairly awful CSS that I might fix up at a later date.

I had a flat white in The Alchemy Experiment while making this, you should go if you’re in
Glasgow.

I decided to get this site into working order as fast as possible, with zero prep time. It
ended up taking 44 minutes, 33 seconds.
